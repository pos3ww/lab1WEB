          <b>Éric Alfred Leslie Satie</b> was a French pianist and avant-garde
          composer. He was also famous for being an author, some of his most
          famous works were published in “Vanity Fair” and “Dadaist 391”. Erik
          Satie was born on May 17, 1866 in Honfleur, Normandy. At the age of
          six, the young Satie was forced to move to his paternal grandparent’s
          house upon the news of his mother’s death. There, his grandparents
          arranged for his first lessons in music. These lessons continued until
          age twelve, after which the young Satie reunited with his father, who
          had now married a piano teacher. Satie then continued his music
          education with his stepmother and at the age of thirteen, he joined
          the famous Paris Conservatoire. However, his time at the Conservatoire
          was not be easy, as his teachers severely disliked his playing style.
          His teachers often remarked that he was “the laziest student in the
          Conservatoire”. Satie, dissatisfied with his time at the Conservatoire
          left it to serve for a year in the army. However, his teachers at the
          Conservatoire who suggested to him to take up composition. Satie’s
          father published three of Satie’s works in 1886. They were titled
          “Elegie”, “Trois Melodies” and “Chanson”. Satie soon followed up his
          initial compositions with more eccentric works such as “Gymnopedies”,
          ”Ogives”, and “Gnossiennes”. In 1887 Satie befriended the famous
          French Impressionist Composer Claude Debussy, and the two often
          discussed the latest trends in music. Satie also found inspiration
          from the artistic gatherings at the famous “Le Chat Noir
          Café-Cabaret”. However, this was a difficult time for Satie
          financially. He survived as a cabaret pianist, adapting popular music
          for the piano. During this period, Satie wrote the music for a
          pantomime by Jules Depaquit titled “Jack in the Box”. In 1905, Satie
          decided to try his luck at counterpoint. He enrolled in the Schola
          Cantorum de Paris under Vincent d’Indy. His newfound efforts to better
          himself served as a precursor to his celebrity status. By 1912, Satie
          partnered with the Spanish Pianist Robert Vines to release a serious
          of humorous piano shorts. These piano shorts showered Satie with
          praise and attention, and it led people to investigate and rediscover
          many of Satie’s lost works. This era saw one of his earliest works,
          Gymnopedies, earn plenty of praise and acclaim. Satie also had the
          French Composer Maurice Ravel to thank for much of his fame, as he
          pointed out Satie’s genius to France’s elite. Post 1912 Satie wrote a
          number of orchestral and instrumental works. In 1918 he wrote the
          “Musique d’ameublement”, and in 1914 he wrote the “Autre Choral”. He
          also wrote ten dramatic pieces after 1912. In 1917, he wrote one of
          his largest vocal works, the “Socrate: Drame Symphonique”. Erik Satie
          died on July 1, 1925 in Paris, France. He developed the cirrhosis of
          the liver, together with pleurisy, which claimed his life. Satie
          received the last rites of the Catholic Church in his death bed. In
          his honor, a tiny stone monument has been erected. Satie received
          plenty of posthumous attention, his friends and colleagues discovered
          many of his works that remained unpublished.

          Satie became the focus of successive groups of young composers, whom
          he first encouraged and then distanced himself from, sometimes
          rancorously, when their popularity threatened to eclipse his or they
          otherwise displeased him. First were the "jeunes" – those associated
          with Ravel – and then a group known at first as the "nouveaux jeunes",
          later called Les Six, including Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur
          Honegger, and Germaine Tailleferre, joined later by Francis Poulenc
          and Darius Milhaud. Satie dissociated himself from the second group in
          1918, and in the 1920s he became the focal point of another set of
          young composers including Henri Cliquet-Pleyel, Roger Désormière,
          Maxime Jacob and Henri Sauguet, who became known as the "Arcueil
          School". In addition to turning against Ravel, Auric and Poulenc in
          particular, Satie quarrelled with his old friend Debussy in 1917,
          resentful of the latter's failure to appreciate the more recent Satie
          compositions. The rupture lasted for the remaining months of Debussy's
          life, and when he died the following year, Satie refused to attend the
          funeral. A few of his protégés escaped his displeasure, and Milhaud
          and Désormière were among those who remained friends with him to the
          last. The First World War restricted concert-giving to some extent,
          but Orledge comments that the war years brought "Satie's second lucky
          break", when Jean Cocteau heard Viñes and Satie perform the Trois
          morceaux in 1916. This led to the commissioning of the ballet Parade,
          premiered in 1917 by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, with music by
          Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide
          Massine. This was a succès de scandale, with jazz rhythms and
          instrumentation including parts for typewriter, steamship whistle and
          siren. It firmly established Satie's name before the public, and
          thereafter his career centred on the theatre, writing mainly to
          commission. In October 1916 Satie received a commission from the
          Princesse de Polignac that resulted in what Orledge rates as the
          composer's masterpiece, Socrate, two years later. Satie set
          translations from Plato's Dialogues as a "symphonic drama". Its
          composition was interrupted in 1917 by a libel suit brought against
          him by a music critic, Jean Poueigh, which nearly resulted in a jail
          sentence for Satie. When Socrate was premiered, Satie called it "a
          return to classical simplicity with a modern sensibility", and among
          those who admired the work was Igor Stravinsky, a composer whom Satie
          regarded with awe. In his later years Satie became known for his
          prose. He was in demand as a journalist, making contributions to the
          Revue musicale, Action, L'Esprit nouveau, the Paris-Journal and other
          publications from the Dadaist 391 to the English-language magazines
          Vanity Fair and The Transatlantic Review. As he contributed
          anonymously or under pen names to some publications it is not certain
          how many titles he wrote for, but Grove's Dictionary of Music and
          Musicians lists 25. Satie's habit of embellishing the scores of his
          compositions with all kinds of written remarks became so established
          that he had to insist that they must not be read out during
          performances.[n 9] In 1920 there was a festival of Satie's music at
          the Salle Erard in Paris. In 1924 the ballets Mercure (with
          choreography by Massine and décor by Picasso) and Relâche
          ("Cancelled") (in collaboration with Francis Picabia and René Clair),
          both provoked headlines with their first night scandals.
          <i
            >Throughout his adult life Satie was a heavy drinker, and in 1925
            his health collapsed. He was taken to the Hôpital Saint-Joseph in
            Paris, diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. He died there at 8.00
            p.m. on 1 July, at the age of 59. He was buried in the cemetery at
            Arcueil.</i
